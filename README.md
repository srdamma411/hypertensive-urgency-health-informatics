# Standardizing Clinical Data: Terminology Selection for Hypertensive Urgency Documentation

This repository contains the final project submitted for the "Health Informatics Standards and Terminologies" course. The project demonstrates a full lifecycle of clinical data standardization using a hypertensive urgency case study.

##  Project Use Case
A 65-year-old patient presents with hypertensive urgency. We documented symptoms, vitals, medications, and clinician/nursing workflows using standardized terminologies and clinical models.

##  Key Contributions
- **Terminology Mapping**: SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD-10
- **Modeling**:
  - UML class diagrams for actors (patient, clinician, nurse, EHR)
  - BPMN diagrams for clinical decision workflows
- **Standardization**: Created a CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) representing all recorded data
- **Interoperability Focus**: Mapped health concepts to standardized vocabularies to support EHR interoperability

##  Technologies and Standards
- SNOMED CT
- LOINC
- RxNorm
- ICD-10
- HL7 CDA
- UML & BPMN Modeling
